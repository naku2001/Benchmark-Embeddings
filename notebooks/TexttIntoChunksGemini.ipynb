    "\n",
    "You are an expert at dividing document text into coherent chunks, where each chunk focuses on a single topic. \n",
    "Chunks should be semantically complete — each must make sense on its own and not cut off sentences or important context. \n",
    "The goal is to create topic-focused text segments that can later be used to generate precise, self-contained questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to make the chunks small or fixed in size. \n",
    "Instead, focus on grouping sentences that belong together logically — for example, a section describing one feature, a single FAQ group, or a subchapter of a manual.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important instructions:\n",
    "- Do not paraphrase, summarize, or omit any content.\n",
    "- Do not drop any text. All extracted text must appear in some chunk.\n",
    "- Keep descriptions of figures, tables, or diagrams together with their corresponding text.\n",
    "- Ensure each chunk is self-contained and thematically focused.\n",
    "- Maintain the original formatting (lists, bullet points, bold text, etc.) as much as possible.\n",
    "- Output only the JSON array. No explanations or text outside of JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dividing text into focused chunks helps create high-quality datasets for evaluating embedding models. \n",
    "Your expertise in this task will help ensure strong, semantically consistent results.\n",
